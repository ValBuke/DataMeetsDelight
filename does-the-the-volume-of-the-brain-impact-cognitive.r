Research has shown that variations in brain volume, particularly in specific regions, are associated with differences in cognitive abilities such as memory, attention, processing speed, and problem-solving skills. For instance, a larger hippocampal volume is often linked to better memory performance, while reductions in prefrontal cortex volume can be associated with diminished executive function and decision-making capabilities. Various factors, including genetics, age, health conditions, and lifestyle choices, can influence brain volume. Understanding the relationship between brain volume and cognitive function is not just interesting, but essential for developing strategies to maintain and improve cognitive health throughout the lifespan.\n\nThis study utilizes a cross-sectional MRI dataset of 416 right-handed subjects aged 18 to 96, each with 3 or 4 T1-weighted scans. It includes 100 subjects over 60 diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a reliability subset of 20 nondemented subjects re-imaged within 90 days. This dataset allows for a detailed analysis of the impact of brain volume on cognitive function across various ages and cognitive states.","metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Research Questions #\n1.Does cognitive function differ by

The regression analysis results indicated that the relationship between brain size and MMSE scores is statistically significant, suggesting that individuals with larger brain volumes tend to have higher MMSE scores, reflecting better cognitive function.
